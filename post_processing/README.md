Folder to perform post processing of pipeline outputs:

Mainly:
- Combine all the Sector Files into a single 'star' output file
- Calculate the completeness of each Sector and the star as a whole 
- Compute the FFD including the completeness corrected Flare rates
- Make completeness FFD plot for each sector 
- Fit a power-law to to each Sector's completeness corrected FFD as well as the whole stars FFD 
- Make beta vs Sector plot 
- Write out data in output file
